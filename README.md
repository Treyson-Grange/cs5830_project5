## Dataset Descriptions

## File Structure

- `project5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for this project.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.
4. Add a `dataset` folder to the main directory.
5. Add in the datasets

- You will need \_**\_ from \_\_\_**

## Usage

- Open the `project5.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.

## Analysis Techniques

Each technique is demonstrated with appropriate visualizations using Seaborn and/or Matplotlib.
